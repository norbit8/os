ANSWERS:

Evaluation - FileWordCounter:

	CPU(s): 16
	Model name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2643 0 @ 3.30GHz
	Architecture: x86_64
Analysis of results:
	As we can see the higher the threads we use the better the runtimes are.
	But, we reached a peak of thread number where increasing the amount of threads did not
	improve the results.
	
Theoretical Questions:

	1. Due to the fact that there is no memory access,
           the optimal number of kernel level threads for the function foo will the number of the cores.
           Adding more threads reduces the frequency of the cpu leading to lower utilization.

	2. n! squared, since the order of the first n prints is non deterministic, as is the order of the
 	   second n threads. However, we know that the children of threads reach the print before the 
           parent threads reach the print. This due to the fact that the children threads don't have to
 	   wait for the barrier in order to print, while the parents do.
