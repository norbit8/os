EX: 3

FILES:
	Barrier.cpp - Barrier source file. 
	Barrier.h - Barrier header file.
	MapReduceFramework.cpp - The Map Reduce Framework.
	fileWordCounter_comparison.png - Runtime graph.
	Makefile - The makefile, which makes the project.
	README - README file.

REMARKS:
No special remarks this time.

ANSWERS:

Evaluation - FileWordCounter:

	CPU(s): 16
	Model name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2643 0 @ 3.30GHz
	Architecture: x86_64
Analysis of results:
	As we can see the higher the threads we use the better the runtimes are.
	But, we reached a peak of thread number where increasing the amount of threads did not
	improve the results.
	
Theoretical Questions:

	1. since there is no memory access,
           the ideal amount of kernel level threads for the function foo should be identical to the amount of the cores.
            the greater the amount of threads, the lower the frequency of the cpu leading to lower utilization.

	2. (a) 2*n squared
	   (b) (n!)^2
