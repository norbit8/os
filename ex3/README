FILES:
	Barrier.cpp - Barrier source file. 
	Barrier.h - Barrier header file.
	MapReduceFramework.cpp - The Map Reduce Framework.
	fileWordCounter_comparison.png - Runtime graph.
	Makefile - The makefile, which makes the project.

REMARKS:
No special remarks this time.

ANSWERS:

Evaluation - FileWordCounter:

	CPU(s): 16
	Model name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2643 0 @ 3.30GHz
	Architecture: x86_64
Analysis of results:
	As we can see the higher the threads we use the better the runtimes are.
	But, we reached a peak of thread number where increasing the amount of threads did not
	improve the results.
	
Theoretical Questions:

	1. Due to the fact that there is no memory access,
           the optimal number of kernel level threads for the function foo will the number of the cores.
           Adding more threads reduces the frequency of the cpu leading to lower utilization.

	2. (a) 2*n squared
	   (b) (2n)!
